Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principle methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software system. 
It helps in creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life i.e healthcare,communication and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming language
establishment of software engineering
the advent of structured progamming in the 1770
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
deployment-releasing the software to users or customers
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall-have sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall, while agile methodology is interative and icremental approach focus on flexibilty colaboration and responding to change.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer is responsible for generating code and implementing software solutions while quality assurance engineer ensure software quality by designing and excuting text plans. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
intergrated development environment is a software suits that provides comprehensive tools for wrtting,debugging and testing code.
version control system is the software tool for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among members.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirement, this may lead to changes during development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays
tight deadline, pressure to deliver software product on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. 
strategies for overcominig challenges, the developer/software engineer should commucate,prioritize task given and regular of reassesment of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
